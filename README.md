# Interface and functionalities

There are two types of accounts: user and admin. The user account contains all the customer functionalities of the web application, while the admin has additional capabilities like:
* Get, Create, Update and Delete any user
* Delete movies

More details will follow in [Admin Pages](#admin-pages)

## Login

After you registered and confirmed your email address, you can login into your account.

![Login Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61846679/148546055-1562595c-f101-45e3-aeff-ef9f9f818c8a.png)

## Main page
 
 Here you can see all the movies added by you in your lists. You can search for any movie in the database, read about it and if you want to see it in the future add it in your wish list or watched list if you have already seen the movie.
 If the movie doesn't exist in the myflix database you can add it through "Add Movie" page.

## Add a movie
 The method in which you can add a new movie is the following: 
  The user needs to go to the Imdb Webpage of the desired movie and copy the part of the URL that contains the movie Id. This id always starts with "tt" letters followed by 7 digits. After this, he will paste the copied id in the secific field from the ![Add movie] page and the movie is added to the database. This feature is possible by making a request to the Data-Imdb Api from RapidAPI.
  This is a free API service that provides a JSON object with all the details of the movie. You can read more about this API here: https://rapidapi.com/SAdrian/api/data-imdb1/

## Friends

The secondary purpose of this web app, besides keeping an archive with all of your seen or wish to see movies, is to also be a community. In this sense, you can be friends with other users and see their favourites movies. (if the user has a public account)
